Ace Editor, a popular embeddable code editor, supports a wide range of themes that can be used to customize its appearance. The theme in Ace Editor is set using the `setTheme` method, as you've already done in your code with the "twilight" theme.

Here is a list of some commonly used Ace Editor themes:

1. **Light Themes**:
   - `ace/theme/chrome`
   - `ace/theme/clouds`
   - `ace/theme/crimson_editor`
   - `ace/theme/dawn`
   - `ace/theme/dreamweaver`
   - `ace/theme/eclipse`
   - `ace/theme/github`
   - `ace/theme/iplastic`
   - `ace/theme/solarized_light`
   - `ace/theme/textmate`
   - `ace/theme/tomorrow`
   - `ace/theme/xcode`

2. **Dark Themes**:
   - `ace/theme/ambiance`
   - `ace/theme/chaos`
   - `ace/theme/clouds_midnight`
   - `ace/theme/cobalt`
   - `ace/theme/dracula`
   - `ace/theme/gob`
   - `ace/theme/gruvbox`
   - `ace/theme/idle_fingers`
   - `ace/theme/kr_theme`
   - `ace/theme/merbivore`
   - `ace/theme/mono_industrial`

   - `ace/theme/solarized_dark`
   - `ace/theme/terminal`
   - `ace/theme/tomorrow_night`
   - `ace/theme/tomorrow_night_blue`
   - `ace/theme/tomorrow_night_bright`
   - `ace/theme/tomorrow_night_eighties`
   - `ace/theme/twilight`
   - `ace/theme/vibrant_ink`

To set a theme, you simply replace the theme string in your `setTheme` call:

```javascript
editor.setTheme("ace/theme/monokai");
```

Please note that the availability of these themes can depend on the version of Ace Editor you are using and how it's been set up in your environment. Some builds of Ace may not include all themes. You might need to include specific theme files in your project or use a build of Ace that includes a wider range of themes.

For the most accurate and up-to-date list of available themes and to check if a specific theme is included in your version of Ace, you might want to refer to the [Ace Editor GitHub repository](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) or your own Ace setup.
